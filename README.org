* Components

The Bazaar backend is broken out into the following components:

- The backend API proper :: this implements the application-layer
     business logic of the platform. The API lives in the ~api~
     directory.
- The SQL database :: all application concerns are persisted here, and
     persistence-level business logic is implemented as stored
     procedures and triggers in PostgreSQL. The SQL lives in the ~db~
     directory.
- The website component :: the server-side components which host the
     frontend website is here. The website is implemented as a
     single-page website, so these are minimal. The website lives in
     the ~web~ directory.
- The ingest pipeline :: this constitues the component which updates
     the database from Seatgeek on a regular basis. This is written as
     a shell pipeline which is as idempotent as possible. These
     scripts live in ~ingest~.
